<h1>Technology Names App</h1>
<p>
  This is an app I'm making to learn about React.js. Would like it to involve the names of webdev technologies that I find funny: Mongoose, Cucumber, Vuvuzela, etc.
  </p>
<p>
  Have an idea where a user would have to guess which of two names is of a real webdev technology and which is made up.
</p>
<p>
  Would also be fun to analyze the names with natural language processing.
